# Biodiversity Intactness Index - Phoenix Division
### Author: Rosemary Juarez
## Goal:
I will be covering Biodiversity Intactness Index change within Maricopa County, which encompasses the Phoenix metropolitan area. In 2021, Maricopa county was the US county that added the most developed land since 2001. Urban sprawl creates pressure on biodiversity and natural areas. I will explore a dataset showing values for a biodiversity intactness index (BII) to find changes in this BII around the Phoenix area from 2017 to 2020.
